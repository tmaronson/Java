1. From docs see example Stream in Java Docs.
2. Create whatever classes, data structures, enums to verify what the statement is showing.
3. Write some unit tests to verify #2.
4. Some sample code is in repo.
5. Some ideas are Widget class? list/collection of Widget objects, Enumeration of Colors instead 
of using static final int types?
6. Based on the statement what are you trying to test in the first place?
7. At any stage, break down the statement in the Stream interface and verify why the methods are either
intermediate methods or terminal methods, what lambdas mean (what interface, method, parameters do they denote?),
what do intermediate methods return so you can chain them?

Later:

From January cohort assignments: Here are the readings/topics to focus on in the below book for the next two days 4.3, 5, 6.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 10.1, 10.2, 11.1- 
She said she will likely begin with Big O and recursion tomorrow.


INTEGER func(INTEGER a, INTEGER b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return 1;
    INTEGER temp = func(a, b / 2);
    if (b % 2 != 0)
        return temp * temp * a;
    else
        return temp * temp;
}
